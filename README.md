# Idea Generator
If you want to practice your front-end skills, but you don't know where to start, or what projects to work on, try this idea generator!

It is currently a work in progress. I might open pull request for adding more ideas from people in the future.

## Langauge and Framework used
+ HTML and JavaScript, with very minimal custom CSS.
+ Bootstrap

## Roadmap
+ functional "do not show again" button
+ filters for specific skills/Language(e.g., html/css, JavaScript, React.js, accessibility support)
